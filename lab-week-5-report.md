# Lab-week-5-report
## Introduction
*Hello! Welcome to this week's lab report. In this lab report, you will learn various uses of the "grep" command through three examples!*

## The "-c" command
Input1:
```
grep -c "Tuesday" chapter-1.txt
```
Output1:
```
3
```

Input2:
```
grep -c "studies" 1468-6708-3-1.txt
```
Output2:
```
10
```

Input3:
```
grep -c "goal" commission_report.txt
```
Output3:
```
2
```
> By using the command "-c", we can know how many lines matches the pattern we have chosen, which is "Tuesday". This option is pretty useful, because it is always important for people to know the frequency of certain words/pattern's occurence in a file, so they can quickly understand if their desired "key word" is in this file or not, which could help people to make decision on continue reading the file or not..
