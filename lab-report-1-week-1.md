Hello! You will need to first install Visual Studio Code to begin the work.

The link is here [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

You can choose the download type based on the type of your type.

## Remotely Connecting
Hello! In this part, you can begin to connect to the server!

You will first need to type the following code in your Visual Studio Code's terminal:
`ssh cs15lfa22pv@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

You will probably get a message like this, but it is fine, just type yes:
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
